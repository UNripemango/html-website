        <p>Music is my heartbeat, and drumming is where I find my groove. A pro drummer and a local music mentor for
            almost
            two decades, I've jammed across classical, studio recordings, and live performances. Sundays, you'll catch
            me
            setting the rhythm at my home church right here in the city.
            In the in-between moments, I'm tuning up for upcoming shows and events. Now, my latest adventure? A Metal
            band
            called Surrounded by Wolves. Started off as their live-show drummer, but the chemistry clicked, and here we
            are.
            It's a bit of a departure from my musical roots, but that's where the magic happens. I'm injecting my unique
            vibe into this genre, creating sounds that are as unique as they are bold.
