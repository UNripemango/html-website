        <p>Not a huge movie buff here, but I've got this unexpected soft spot for action flicks. Lately, I've been
            vibing
            with The Dark Knight trilogy – total Batman nerd, guilty as charged. I mean, c'mon, any Batman movie is a
            must-watch for me. And then there's the John Wick series – talk about a wild ride. The thrill and fast-paced
            action scenes in that one, almost bordering on comical, just get me. It's like those horror movies where
            characters do the silliest things and somehow survive. Same deal with John Wick – doing the most insane
            stuff,
            and no one's biting the dust. It's kinda silly, but I love it!</p>
